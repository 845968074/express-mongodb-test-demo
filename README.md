=================

A basic es6 project, which includes:

1. webpack
2. babel

All the changes to js/jsx files can be hot-reloaded in browser.

```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000>, you will see `Hello world` on the page.

If you modify `public/hello.jsx` to change the text, you will see the changes are applied to page instantly.
